CMD3
====

Simple command line with a plugin interface.

This was designed mostly to be used as an API
for some little utilites I wanted to write,
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPLACE A UNIX SHELL WITH THIS

Command line arguments:
    A command line with command line
arguments! How funny! (not really because
every other command line has them too but
I found humor in that.)
There are only two options:
-h  -  Prints out a little dialog about
        command line options and then
        interally calls help.
-e  -  Executes an interal command, this
        still is run as long as it is
        before -h (so you can see whats
        in a plugin, etc.) usefull for
        useing a batch file to load a
        plugin before launch. If the
        command contains any spaces put
        it in quotes.

Built in commands:
    Ugh, theres a reason this is CMD3
and not cmd1 or cmd2, the downfall of
cmd1 was that it wasn't extensable, the
downfall of cmd2 was that everything was
object-oriented and dynamic and the load
function had to be static but needed to
access a member value and blah blah blah.
CMD3 is the right balance of both. :)

HELP:
    This command prints out a description
    of all the interal commands and then
    steps through all the plugin commands.

LOAD [Filename]:
    Tries to load [Filename] as a plugin.

EXIT [Number]:
    Quits the program, you can optionally
    specify a code to return, if nothing is
    entered it defaults to 0.
